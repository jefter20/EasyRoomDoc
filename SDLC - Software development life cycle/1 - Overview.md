Here is an overview of the entire software development lifecycle for a hotel booking platform using React for the front-end and C# for the back-end:
### 1.1 - **Requirements Gathering**

- **Functional**:
    - Hotel, room, and category registration.
    - Hotel search system with filters (location, price, date, etc.).
    - Display of room details (images, description, amenities, price).
    - Reservation system with availability checks.
    - User authentication (customers and administrators).
    - Reservation and payment history.
    - Integration with a payment gateway.
- **Non-functional**:
    - Security (protection of sensitive data, such as payment information).
    - Scalability (potential growth in the number of users and data).
    - Performance (fast response time for searches and operations).
    - Usability (simple and easy-to-navigate interface).
- **Technologies**:
    - Front-end: React (JavaScript).
    - Back-end: C# (.NET Core).
    - Database: SQL Server or another relational database.
    - Hosting: Azure or AWS.
### 1.2 - **Agile methodology**

- Scrum, Kanban, etc.

### 1.3 - **Timeline**

- Define schedule

### 1.4 - **Architecture Design**

- **Front-end (React)**:
    - Creation of reusable components for hotel search, displaying details, login system, and reservations.
    - Use of React Router for page navigation.
    - Integration with backend APIs for fetching data and managing reservations.
    - State management using Redux or Context API to handle global data.
- **Back-end (C#)**:
    - Development of a RESTful API using .NET Core.
    - Implementation of controllers for hotel, room, reservation, and user functionalities.
    - Authentication service (JWT Tokens) for security.
    - Database integration via Entity Framework to manage data.
    - Payment service integration with gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
- **Database**:
    - Structuring tables for hotels, rooms, reservations, users, and financial transactions.
    - Defining relationships (room belongs to a hotel, reservation related to room and user).
- Architecture:
	- Define system architecture

### 1.5 - **Prototyping**

- Creation of wireframes and mockups for screen designs such as home page, search page, hotel details page, reservation process, and login area.
- Tools like Figma or Adobe XD can be used for prototyping.

### 1.6 - **Development**

- **Front-end**:
    - Development of React components, with dynamic pages for search results, room details, and reservation interface.
    - Integration with back-end APIs for fetching data, user login, and reservation confirmation.
    - Implementation of form validations, such as available dates and payment details.
- **Back-end**:
    - Implementation of RESTful endpoints for hotel, room, reservation, and user registration.
    - Business logic for checking room availability, calculating prices, and managing payments.
    - Security setup with authentication and authorization for different user levels (customer vs. admin).
    - Unit tests for developed APIs.

### 1.7 - **Testing**

- **Unit Testing**:
    - Testing individual components (e.g., hotel search, date validation, login system).
- **Integration Testing**:
    - Testing to ensure the front-end communicates correctly with the back-end.
    - Validation of complete workflows, such as searching for hotels, selecting a room, and completing a reservation.
- **Usability Testing**:
    - Ensuring the user interface is intuitive and efficient across different devices.
- **Performance Testing**:
    - Evaluating the response time of searches and reservations under high load conditions.

### 1.8 - **Deployment**

- **Back-end**:
    - Hosting the API on servers such as Azure App Services or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
    - Database configuration in the cloud (Azure SQL Database or Amazon RDS).
- **Front-end**:
    - Deployment of the React application on services like Vercel, Netlify, or directly to cloud web servers.
- **CI/CD Automation**:
    - Setting up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or Jenkins to automate integration and continuous delivery.

### 1.9 - **Maintenance and Updates**

- Monitoring errors and logs to identify and fix system issues.
- Regular updates for new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.
- Scaling infrastructure as the user base grows, adjusting servers and databases accordingly.

### 1.10 - **Future Enhancements**

- Adding features like room reviews, a rewards system for frequent users, and support for multiple currencies and languages.
- Integration with third-party services like maps (Google Maps) to display hotel locations.
