#### **1.1 Functional Requirements**

These describe what the system should do, focusing on the features and functionalities that will be implemented. Here's a breakdown for a hotel reservation platform:

1. **User Registration and Authentication**
    
    - Users (customers and hotel administrators) must be able to create accounts.
    - Password recovery features (password changes).
    
1. **Hotel and Room Management (Admin Only)**
    
    - Admins should be able to add new hotels, rooms, and amenities via a dashboard.
    - Each hotel entry must include:
        - Hotel name, location, contact information, and description.
        - Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, breakfast, pool, etc.).
        - Room types and availability (single, double, suite, etc.).
        - Prices for each room type based on season or time of year.
        - Images of the hotel and rooms.
    - Admins should manage room availability and modify details (edit or delete).
    
1. **Search Functionality**
    
    - Users must be able to search for hotels based on various filters:
        - Location (city, country, etc.).
        - Price range.
        - Date range (check-in and check-out).
        - Room type or amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, breakfast, etc.).
    - Search results should be sortable (e.g., by price, rating, distance).
    
1. **Hotel/Room Details**
    
    - Users should see detailed pages for each hotel/room including:
        - Images of the hotel and rooms.
        - Descriptions, amenities, and room prices.
        - Customer reviews and ratings (optional).
        - Availability calendar for booking.
    
1. **Reservation System**
    
    - Users should be able to select dates and book available rooms.
    - The system should check room availability and prevent double booking.
    - The platform should show the total price based on selected dates and number of guests.
    - Users should receive a booking confirmation email with reservation details.
    - Admins should be able to view and manage bookings (approve/cancel).
    
1. **Payment Gateway Integration**
    
    - Users must be able to pay for reservations securely using a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal.
    - Support for multiple payment methods (credit card, debit card, etc.).
    - Ensure security for transactions (SSL, PCI compliance).
    - Option to save payment methods for future bookings.
    
1. **User Profile and Booking History**
    
    - Users should have access to their profiles, where they can view and update personal details.
    - Users should be able to view past and upcoming bookings.
    - Option to cancel or modify upcoming reservations based on hotel policies.

#### **1.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

These requirements focus on the system's behavior and characteristics, which are essential for delivering a high-quality user experience and a secure, scalable application.

1. **Security**
    
    - **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication using tokens (JWT) for session management.
    - **Encryption**: Use HTTPS and encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and payment information.
    - **Role-based Access Control**: Ensure only administrators can access hotel and room management features, while regular users can only book rooms and manage their profiles.
    - **Data Privacy**: Comply with relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA) to safeguard user data.
    
1. **Scalability**
    
    - Ensure the platform can handle increasing numbers of users, hotels, and bookings without performance degradation.
    - Utilize a scalable database (e.g., Azure SQL, Amazon RDS) and cloud infrastructure to grow the system as needed.
3. **Performance**
    
    - The system should load quickly, with minimal delay for searches and reservations.
    - Optimize API performance to reduce response times, especially during high-load periods (e.g., peak booking seasons).
    - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data (e.g., hotel search results).
    
1. **Usability**
    
    - The user interface should be intuitive, mobile-friendly, and accessible to all users, regardless of technical skills.
    - Ensure compatibility across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
    - Provide helpful error messages and feedback (e.g., when a room is unavailable or payment fails).
    
1. **Reliability and Availability**
    
    - Aim for 99.9% uptime with proper monitoring and alerting in place to address potential issues (e.g., downtime or API failures).
    - Implement database backups and recovery plans to avoid data loss in case of failure.
    - Use distributed server infrastructure (cloud) to minimize downtime.
    
1. **Maintainability**
    
    - Write clean, modular, and documented code to facilitate future maintenance and updates.
    - Use industry-standard tools for version control (e.g., Git) and continuous integration (CI/CD).
    - Ensure that the system is easily testable with automated test suites for both front-end and back-end.
    
1. **Compliance**
    
    - Ensure compliance with local and international regulations regarding data security, payments, and privacy, such as GDPR for European customers or PCI-DSS for handling payments.

#### **1.3 Technologies to Support Requirements**

- **Front-end**: React will handle the user interface. Key libraries and tools include:
    
    - React Router for page navigation.
    - Redux or Context API for state management.
    - Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests to the back-end.
    - Bootstrap or Material UI for consistent UI design.
    
- **Back-end**: C# (.NET Core) will serve the business logic, and essential components include:
    
    - Controllers for each resource (hotels, rooms, reservations, users).
    - Entity Framework for object-relational mapping (ORM) and database interactions.
    - JWT for secure user authentication and role-based access control.
    
- **Database**: SQL Server or similar relational databases to store structured data like users, hotels, rooms, and bookings.
    
- **Cloud and Hosting**:
    
    - Use cloud platforms like Azure or AWS for both front-end and back-end deployment.
    - Serverless options or containerized services (e.g., Docker) to simplify scaling.
