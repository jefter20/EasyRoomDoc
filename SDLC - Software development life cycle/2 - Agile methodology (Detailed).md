### 1. **Team Formation**

- **Multidisciplinary**: Gather a team with diverse skills (developers, designers, testers, product owners, etc.).

- **Defined Roles**: Define the roles and responsibilities of each team member, such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, and developers.

### 2. **Choosing an Agile Framework**

- Select a suitable Agile framework, such as **Scrum**, **Kanban**, or a combination (ScrumBan).

- **Scrum** is ideal for projects with incremental deliveries and iterations (sprints), while **Kanban** is more flexible and continuous.

### 3. **Initial Planning**

- **General Requirements**: Gather the project requirements, aligning expectations with stakeholders (clients, end users).

- **Create the Backlog**: Organize all functionalities, user stories, and tasks in the backlog.

- **Prioritize**: Work with the Product Owner to prioritize the backlog based on business value.

### 4. **Defining Work Cycles (Sprints or Iterations)**

- **Sprints**: Define the work cycle (usually 2 to 4 weeks).

- At the beginning of each sprint, select the highest-priority user stories to be developed in that cycle.

### 5. **Agile Meetings**

- **Sprint Planning Meeting**: Define the scope and goals of the sprint.

- **Daily Stand-ups**: Quick daily meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and align the team.

- **Sprint Review**: At the end of the sprint, review what was delivered with stakeholders.

- **Retrospective**: Evaluate what worked well and what needs improvement for the next sprint.

### 6. **Incremental and Iterative Development**

- **Frequent Deliveries**: Deliver functional increments of software at the end of each sprint or iteration.

- **Adaptation to Changes**: Be prepared for changes in requirements throughout the project, with the team quickly adjusting.

### 7. **Continuous Integration and Automated Testing**

- **Test Automation**: Build a solid base of automated tests to ensure continuous quality.

- **Continuous Integration**: Implement CI/CD processes to ensure code is continuously integrated and tested.

### 8. **Continuous Feedback**

- **Constant Reviews**: Collect feedback from users and stakeholders throughout the process.

- **Backlog Adjustments**: Adjust the backlog based on feedback, always focusing on the most valuable features for the client.

### 9. **Continuous Delivery and Deployment**

- Deliver the software to the client in small increments that can be tested and adjusted quickly.

- Continuous delivery enables product refinement and the incorporation of changes over time.

### 10. **Continuous Improvement**

- After each sprint, the team should analyze performance and identify areas for improvement.

- Apply lessons learned to the next iterations, continuously improving the Agile process.

### 11. **Light Documentation**

- Keep the necessary documentation minimal but always accessible and relevant, ensuring the team understands the product and the process without creating an overload.

### 12. **Adaptation and Evolution**

- As the project progresses, the team and stakeholders can adjust the Agile process, customizing practices to better meet the specific needs of the project.
